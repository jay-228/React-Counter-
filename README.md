Objective:

Build a simple counter application using React and the useState hook. The application should have a counter initialized to 0 and two buttons: one for incrementing the counter value and one for decrementing it.

Requirements:

Create a React component named CounterApp.
Initialize the counter value to 0 using the useState hook.
Display the current counter value.
Implement three buttons: one to increment the counter and one to decrement it and one reset button.
When the "Increment" button is clicked, the counter value should increase by one.
When the "Decrement" button is clicked, the counter value should decrease by one.
Ensure that the counter value cannot go below 0.
When the "Reset" button is clicked, the counter value 0.
